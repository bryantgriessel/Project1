# **Walkability Score and Obesity Correlation Analysis**

## Project Overview
Welcome to the Walkability Score and Obesity Correlation Analysis project! This collaborative effort aims to investigate the potential correlation between walkability scores and obesity rates across the top 15 most populous states in the United States *(and Hawaii)*. 

This project is a collaborative effort brought to you by Team 3 ... comprised of the following team members:

- Mauricio Andrews - Visualization and Plotting

- Nathaniel Cervantez - Visualizations

- Isaac Gish - Visualization and Plotting

- Bryant Griessel - Data Collection and API Calls

- Mark Helotie - Data Collection and API Calls

- Manasi Shidhaye - Documenation and Project Design

## Project Goals

Data Collection: Search reputable databases for data relating to obesity and walk score/walkability index

Correlation Analysis: Explore and analyze the potential correlation between walkability scores and obesity rates in the United States.

Data Visualization - Provide meaningful visualizations to help the viewers understand the data analysis.

## Methodology

Data Collection: Gather walkability scores and obesity rate data from reliable sources.

Data Preprocessing: Clean, prepare, and format the collected data for analysis.

Correlation Analysis: Utilize statistical methods to assess the correlation between walkability scores and obesity rates.

Data Visualization: Create informative visualizations using Matplotlib to illustrate the correlation between walkability and obesity rate, if one exists.

Interpretation: Interpret the results, considering potential confounding variables and implications.

## Data Sources
The following data sources were used for this analysis:

Walkability Score Data: [Walk Score API](https://www.walkscore.com/professional/api.php)

Obesity Rate Data: [Data.gov](https://catalog.data.gov/dataset/500-cities-local-data-for-better-health-2016-release)

## Data Collection

Data collection was performed by **Mark** & **Bryant** using the specified data sources above. Walkability scores were collected for each of the top 15 most populous states using API calls on the Walk Score API.

## Data Analysis
The collected data was subjected to thorough analysis using statistical techniques. Correlation coefficients and p-values were calculated to determine the strength and significance of the relationship between walkability scores and obesity rates.
