# OBESITY_DATA

This dataset was downloaded from
https://catalog.data.gov/dataset/500-cities-local-data-for-better-health-2016-release

The original CSV download was 217MB.  Un-needed rows and columns were manually removed, and that resulted in this CSV of 4.5MB

(we were facing challenges uploading the full CSV into GitHub)

Some notes for the data in this CSV:

- Column F ("UniqueID") is comprised of the combination of "CityFIPS" (column M) and "TractFIPS" (column N).
- Column H ("Data_Value") is the actual obesity percentage of adults (18+).
- Column K ("Population2010") is the population of this specific census tract.
- Column L ("GeoLocation") is the latitude/longitude coordinates of the specific census tract.
